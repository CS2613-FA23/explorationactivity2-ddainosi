# ExplorationActivity2
### Which package/library does the sample program demonstrate?
The sample program demonstrates basic functions from the jQuery JavaScript library. The library is used for enhancing user interfaces.

### How does someone run your program?
Follow the listed steps below:
- Under the ![Code](/media/code_button.png) button on GitHub, click **Download Zip**
- Extract the **.zip** file contents into your `Downloads` folder on your device for simplicity.
- On the **Terminal**, type the following:
  ```sh
  cd Downloads/explorationactivity2-ddainosi
  npm install jquery
  ```
- Click on index.html in the explorationactivity2-ddainosi folder on **File Explorer** or **Finder**

### What purpose does your program serve?
At my work, giveaways are held from time-to-time. The purpose of this program was to make picking a winner easier and for it to be specific to the business. 

### What would be some sample input/output?
Try clicking the Click Me! Button:
- The message will change to a select number of phrases and the colour will change; both at random.
Try inputting a list of names and click the **Generate** button:
- The **Generate** button changes to a darker shade of the blue when the mouse hovers over the element
- The winnerâ€™s name plays a small animation

There are some other features hidden in the website, can you find them? Hover your mouse over certain elements and find out!

Example:
